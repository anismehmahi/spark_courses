In Spark, the `--master` and `--deploy-mode` parameters can be combined in specific ways to define the execution environment for Spark applications. Here’s a rundown of the possible combinations and what each configuration means:

### 1. `--master local` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master local --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark in a single-threaded local mode. Both the driver and executor run on the same single machine (your local machine), using only one core. Useful for testing small applications or during development, especially for quick testing and debugging.

### 2. `--master local[N]` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master local[8] --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Similar to `local` mode, but here Spark runs with `N` parallel threads (where `N` is a number you specify, such as `8`). This setting allows Spark to utilize multiple cores on your local machine. Both the driver and executors run locally in parallel, with `N` threads, so it's useful for development and testing on a single machine that has multiple CPU cores.

### 3. `--master local[*]` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master local[*] --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark locally using all available cores on your machine (`*` represents all cores). Similar to `local[N]`, this runs both the driver and executors on the local machine. This option can maximize resource usage for single-machine testing but is still meant for development rather than production.

### 4. `--master spark://<master-url>:<port>` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master spark://192.168.1.100:7077 --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Connects to a standalone Spark cluster (defined by the `spark://<master-url>:<port>` address). The driver runs on your local machine (client mode), while executors run on the cluster nodes. This setup is useful for submitting jobs from a client machine while utilizing the resources of a standalone Spark cluster.

### 5. `--master spark://<master-url>:<port>` and `--deploy-mode cluster`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master spark://192.168.1.100:7077 --deploy-mode cluster`
- **Explanation:** The application runs on a standalone Spark cluster, with the driver running on one of the worker nodes in the cluster (not on your local machine). This is useful for production jobs, as it fully leverages the cluster and doesn’t require your client machine to stay connected after submission. It’s ideal for automated or scheduled jobs in production environments.

### 6. `--master yarn` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark on a Hadoop YARN cluster, with the driver on your local machine. Executors are launched on YARN-managed resources in the cluster. This setup allows interactive usage where you submit jobs from a client machine and interact with them, typically suited for development and debugging on a YARN cluster.

### 7. `--master yarn` and `--deploy-mode cluster`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark on a YARN cluster, but with the driver running within the YARN cluster (on a node assigned by YARN). This configuration is often used for production jobs since it doesn’t require your local machine to maintain a connection to the driver. The application is entirely managed by the YARN cluster.

### 8. `--master mesos://<mesos-url>` and `--deploy-mode client`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master mesos://192.168.1.100:5050 --deploy-mode client`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark on a Mesos cluster with the driver on your local machine. Executors are managed by Mesos and run on Mesos-managed nodes. Like the other `client` modes, it’s suitable for development, debugging, or interactive applications.

### 9. `--master mesos://<mesos-url>` and `--deploy-mode cluster`
- **Command example:** `spark-submit --master mesos://192.168.1.100:5050 --deploy-mode cluster`
- **Explanation:** Runs Spark on a Mesos cluster, with the driver running on one of the Mesos-managed nodes. This configuration is intended for production jobs, as it runs entirely on the cluster and doesn’t require a client machine connection once the job is submitted.

spark-submit --master k8s://https://k8s-api-server:6443 ...

### 10. `--master k8s://https://k8s-api-server:6443` and `--deploy-mode client`
### 11. `--master k8s://https://k8s-api-server:6443` and `--deploy-mode cluster`
   - **`k8s://https://HOST:PORT`**: Connects to a Kubernetes cluster. Replace `HOST` and `PORT` with the Kubernetes API server details.
   - Requires additional configurations, such as a Docker image and namespace.

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   spark-submit --master k8s://https://k8s-api-server:6443 ...
   ```

Each of these combinations allows you to tailor Spark’s behavior depending on the environment (local machine or cluster) and the job’s purpose (development or production).
