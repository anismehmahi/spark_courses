What is the relationship between Docker and Yarn ?

Question : so yarn encapsulate executors into containers right ? and those containers are yarn-native containers ? if I want to include docker here is how : the yarn manages the resources allocation and it sends the docker containers of executors to those machines effectively ? is this right ?

### **1. How YARN Encapsulates Executors**
- **YARN-Native Containers**: 
  - YARN uses its own native containerization system to encapsulate executors. These containers are not the same as Docker containers but rather a resource allocation abstraction managed by YARN's NodeManagers.
  - Each YARN container includes the necessary resources (CPU, memory) and executes the Spark executor process within the allocated resources.

### **2. Introducing Docker with YARN**
If you want to use Docker containers in a Spark-on-YARN setup, the process involves layering Docker on top of YARN. Here's how it works:

- **YARN Allocates Resources**:
  - YARN still acts as the **resource manager**, deciding which nodes to use and how much CPU/memory to allocate for executors.

- **YARN Executes Docker Containers**:
  - Instead of running executors directly in YARN-native containers, YARN can be configured to launch **Docker containers** that encapsulate the Spark executors. These Docker containers include all the dependencies and configurations for Spark.

---

### **3. Process Flow**
1. **YARN as Resource Manager**:
   - The Spark application submits its job to YARN, which manages the overall scheduling and resource allocation.

2. **Docker for Executor Isolation**:
   - The YARN NodeManager is configured to use Docker for containerization.
   - When resources are allocated to a Spark executor, YARN instructs the NodeManager to pull and start a **Docker container** for that executor.

3. **Executor in Docker**:
   - The Docker container runs the Spark executor process inside it. The container provides isolation and ensures a consistent environment across nodes.

4. **Resource Management**:
   - YARN still tracks and enforces resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU) even though the executor is running inside a Docker container.

---

### **Key Configurations to Enable Docker with YARN**
To make this setup work:
- **YARN Configuration**:
  - Set up YARN NodeManagers to use Docker as a container runtime by enabling container-executor configurations.
- **Spark Configuration**:
  - Configure Spark to use Docker containers for executors by providing the Docker image and related settings.
  - Example setting: `spark.executor.container.image=<docker-image>`.

---

### **Benefits of Combining Docker and YARN**
- **Resource Management**: YARN still handles scheduling and allocation, ensuring efficient use of the cluster.
- **Portability**: Docker provides a consistent environment for Spark executors, reducing dependency issues.
- **Isolation**: Docker ensures that executors are isolated from each other and from the host environment.

### **Your Understanding Is Correct, With One Clarification**
> "**YARN manages the resources allocation and sends the Docker containers of executors to those machines effectively.**"

Yes, this is accurate! The only nuance is that **YARN doesn't "send" Docker containers** but rather instructs the NodeManagers on specific nodes to **pull the specified Docker image** (if not already available) and start a container for the executor.

In summary:
- YARN allocates resources (nodes + memory/CPU).
- The NodeManager on the allocated node starts a Docker container using the specified Docker image.
- Inside the Docker container, the Spark executor runs, managed by YARN.
